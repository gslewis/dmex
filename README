Daisymaths Exercises
====================

This library comprises two modules: the 'core' module contains the
exercise/problem model, the exercise implementations and problem renderers to
produce XML representations (DOM and SAX); and the 'pdf' module which contains
renderers to produce PDF output.

Building
--------
Requires Java 1.6.  The library is built using Apache Ant (tested with
Ant 1.8.1).  Use 'ant -projecthelp' to see a list of available targets.

Local build settings can be provided using a build.properties file in the base
directory.  You can copy conf/build.properties-sample and modify for your own
usage.

The 'core' module has no dependencies (at the moment).

The 'pdf' module requires Apache Fop (1.0) and all its dependencies.  See
lib/pdf/README for a list.  The jars can either be copied to lib/pdf or you
can set the "pdf.jars" classpath property in your build.properties file to
include the paths to the jars.

If you don't want the PDF module, set the "modules.includes" property in your
build.properties to be blank.

The modules are compiled to build/<module_name> directories and the jars are
created in the target/ directory.  Compilation of each module is handled by
the src/<module_name>/build-module.xml build file which is called from the
'compile' target of the top-level build file.
