== Overview ==

Daisymaths was originally developed by Professor Myles Harding to teach
elementary maths.  It was an interactive Java applet and application.  Later a
web application was introduced that generated PDF problem sheets.  This was
written in Perl and used mod_perl.  The PDF generation was done using XSL:FO
and Apache Fop (http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/).

The DMEX Java library attempts to revive some of the PDF generation resources,
this time using pure Java.  It comprises:

. The Exercise/Problem model which represents problems as Java classes.
. Various exercise implementations: times tables, long multiplication, etc.
. Classes for producing a random sequence of problems while avoiding problem
  repetition.
. The rendering model that allows transformation of problems in some render
  context.
. Various rendering implementations: XML (DOM & SAX), HTML, PDF.

A separate project uses the DMEX library to provide various webapps.

NOTE: For now, refer to the Javadoc for model details.
