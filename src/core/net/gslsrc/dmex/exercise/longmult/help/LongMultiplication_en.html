<h2>Long Multiplication</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p><b>Long Multiplication</b> produces standard long multiplication exercises
with various lengths of multiplicand and multiplier.  The problem is presented
as a series of lines:</p>

<ol>
    <li>the <i>multiplicand</i></li>
    <li>the <i>multiplier</i></li>
    <li>2 or more blank intermediate lines of working calculations</li>
    <li>the blank answer line</li>
</ol>

<p>The number of intermediate lines equals the number of digits in the
multiplier.</p>

<h3>Problem Definition</h3>

<p>A long multiplication problem is defined by its <i>multiplicand</i>
(top) and its <i>multiplier</i> (bottom) terms.  A problem is defined by
selecting a level of difficulty which controls the lengths (number of
digits) of the multiplicand and multiplier.  These lengths are:</p>

<table cols="3" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<thead>
<tr><th>Difficulty</th><th>Multiplicand</th><th>Multiplier</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Easiest</th>
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Easy</th>
<td align="center">2, 3</td>
<td align="center">2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Medium</th>
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center">2, 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Hard</th>
<td align="center">3, 4</td>
<td align="center">2, 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Hardest</th>
<td align="center">4</td>
<td align="center">3, 4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The length of the answer is limited to 7 digits to prevent overflow of
the problem on the generated page so some combinations of multiplicand and
multiplier are not allowed.</p>

<h3>Number of Problems</h3>

<p>All problem definitions produce in excess of a thousand unique problem
so there is no danger of exact duplication on a problem sheet.</p>

<h3>Answers</h3>

<p>Answers can be provided either as a separate problem sheet, with each
problem filled in, or on the same sheet in the right-hand margin.</p>
