<h2>Tables Revision</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
    
<p><b>Tables Revision</b> produces 2-term multiplication and division problems
in a range of formats of varying difficulty.</p>
        
<h3>Term Selection</h3>
    
<p>To define a problem it is necessary to select the required values for
<i>term1</i> and for <i>term2</i>.  (Note that <i>term1</i> does not
necessarily appear on the left side of the equation.)  Each term can include
any set of integers from 1 to 12 or <i>All</i> values (ie., 1 to 12
inclusive).</p>

<h3>Difficulty</h3>

<p>It is also necessary to select the problem difficulty which controls the
range of problem types that are generated.  There are 16 problem types.  At the
<i>Easiest</i> difficulty level, only the first two types are used.  At the
<i>Hardest</i> difficulty level, all 16 types are used. The problem types
are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Standard multiplication with answer in right-hand side (RHS)</li>
<li>Same as <b>Type 1</b> but swapping <i>term1</i> and <i>term2</i></li>
<li>Standard multiplication with answer in left-hand side (LHS) second term</li>
<li>Same as <b>Type 3</b> but swapping <i>term1</i> and <i>term2</i></li>
<li>Standard multiplication with answer in LHS first term</li>
<li>Same as <b>Type 5</b> but swapping <i>term1</i> and <i>term2</i></li>
<li>Standard division with answer in RHS</li>
<li>Standard division with answer in LHS second term</li>
<li>Standard division with answer in LHS first term</li>
<li>Fractional multiplication with answer in RHS, fraction in LHS second
    term</li>
<li>Fractional multiplication with answer in RHS, fraction in LHS first
    term</li>
<li>Fractional multiplication with answer in LHS first term, fraction in LHS
    second term</li>
<li>Fractional multiplication with fraction in LHS second term and the
    answer in the denominator</li>
<li>Fractional division with fraction in LHS second term and answer in
    RHS.</li>
<li>Fractional division with fraction in LHS second term and answer in LHS
    first term.</li>
<li>Fractional division with fraction in LHS second term and answer in
    denominator.</li>
</ol>

<p>The number of possible problems is further expanded by flipping the equation
about the &quot;=&quot; sign.</p>

<p>Depending on the problem definition that is chosen (ie., the possible
values of <i>term1</i> and <i>term2</i> as well as the difficulty level), a
certain number of unique problems can be created.  For example, if only one
number is picked for each of <i>term1</i> and <i>term2</i> on the
<i>Easiest</i> difficulty level, then there are only 4 unique problems.</p>
