<h2>Long Division</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The <b>Long Division</b> exercise produces long division problems of
varying difficulty.  A long division problem lays out the working that is
necessary to reach the answer.</p>

<h3>Problem Definition</h3>

<p>A problem is defined by its <i>divisor</i> and <i>dividend</i>.  From these
the answer in the form of a <i>quotient</i> and a <i>remainder</i> can be
calculated.</p>

<p>The choice of divisor and dividend is given by the difficulty level.
The ranges of values are:</p>

<table cols="3" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<thead>
<tr><th>Difficulty</th><th>Divisor</th><th>Dividend</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Easiest</th><td>11-&gt;13</td><td>14-&gt;19</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Easy</th><td>14-&gt;19</td><td>101-&gt;999</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Medium</th><td>21-&gt;39</td><td>101-&gt;999</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Hard</th><td>41-&gt;99</td><td>1001-&gt;9999</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Hardest</th><td>51-&gt;499</td><td>10001-&gt;99999</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><b>Note:</b> The <i>Easiest</i> difficulty level introduces the concept of
the <em>remainder</em>.  The quotient will always be 1.</p>

<p>It is possible to show a table of multiplication equations for the divisor
where the multiplier value is from 2 to 9.  These hints allow the student to
gauge the largest multiple of the divisor that is smaller than the current
dividend.</p>

<p>The number of problems is fixed by difficulty level and there is only a
risk of duplication at the <i>Easiest</i> level (which has only 18 unique
problems).</p>
